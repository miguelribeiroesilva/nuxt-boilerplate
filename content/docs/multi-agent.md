1. **Multiple Agents**
   - Each agent has a specific role
   - Configurable temperature and parameters
   - Role-specific knowledge and capabilities

2. **Agent Configuration**
   - Customize agent roles
   - Adjust model parameters
   - Set interaction patterns

3. **Collaborative Problem Solving**
   - Agents share information
   - Build on each other's insights
   - Reach consensus on solutions

## How to Use

1. Configure the agents based on your needs
2. Present your problem or question
3. Watch as agents collaborate to:
