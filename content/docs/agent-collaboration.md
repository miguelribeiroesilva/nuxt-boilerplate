# Agent Collaboration

This demo showcases a multi-agent collaboration system where different AI agents work together to solve complex problems. The system includes:

## Agents

1. **Programmer**
   - Specializes in implementing solutions in code
   - Writes functions and algorithms
   - Handles technical implementation details

2. **Mathematician**
   - Helps with mathematical concepts and calculations
   - Provides formulas and mathematical explanations
   - Verifies mathematical correctness

3. **Critic**
   - Reviews solutions for improvements
   - Identifies potential edge cases
   - Suggests optimizations and best practices

## How it Works

1. You submit a task or question
2. The Programmer agent starts by proposing an initial solution
3. Based on the content, it may pass to:
   - Mathematician for mathematical analysis
   - Critic for review and improvements
4. Agents collaborate until a comprehensive solution is reached

## Example Tasks

- "Create a function to calculate prime numbers"
- "Design an efficient sorting algorithm"
- "Help me understand the math behind neural networks"
