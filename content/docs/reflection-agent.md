# Reflection Agent

The Reflection Agent demonstrates an AI's ability to think about its own reasoning process and improve its responses through self-reflection.

## Features

1. **Self-Reflection**
   - Analyzes its own responses
   - Identifies potential improvements
   - Considers alternative approaches

2. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Initial response generation
   - Reflection on the response
   - Refinement based on reflection

3. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Evaluates confidence in responses
   - Identifies areas of uncertainty
   - Provides confidence scores

## How it Works

1. You ask a question or present a problem
2. The agent generates an initial response
3. It reflects on the quality and completeness of its answer
4. Based on reflection, it may:
   - Provide additional information
   - Correct misconceptions
   - Offer alternative perspectives

## Best Used For

- Complex problem-solving
- Decision-making scenarios
- Explanations requiring depth and nuance
- Tasks benefiting from multiple perspectives

## Sample Questions

1. "Explain your thought process as you solve this programming problem."
2. "Walk me through your reasoning for this architectural decision."
3. "Analyze your previous response and suggest potential improvements."
4. "Show me how you arrived at this conclusion, including any assumptions made."
5. "Reflect on different approaches you considered for solving this problem."

These questions help demonstrate the agent's ability to explain its thinking and reflect on its decisions.
