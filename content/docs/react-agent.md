# ReAct Agent

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent combines reasoning and action to solve complex tasks step by step.

## Capabilities

1. **Reasoning**
   - Breaks down complex problems
   - Plans solution steps
   - Evaluates approaches

2. **Acting**
   - Executes planned actions
   - Performs calculations
   - Generates code or text

3. **Observation**
   - Monitors results
   - Adjusts approach based on outcomes
   - Learns from feedback

## How it Works

1. **Think**: Agent reasons about the problem
2. **Act**: Executes a specific action
3. **Observe**: Evaluates the result
4. **Repeat**: Continues until task completion

## Best Used For

- Complex problem-solving
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Tasks requiring planning
- Problems needing systematic approach

## Example Tasks

- Mathematical problem-solving
- Algorithm development
- Logic puzzles
- Multi-step analysis

## Sample Questions

1. "Help me solve this math problem step by step."
2. "Guide me through developing an algorithm for this task."
3. "Assist me in solving this logic puzzle, breaking it down into manageable parts."
4. "Walk me through a multi-step analysis of this data set."
5. "Help me plan and execute a solution to this complex problem."

These questions showcase the agent's ability to reason and act on complex tasks.
